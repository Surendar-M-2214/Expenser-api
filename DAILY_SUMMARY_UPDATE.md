## Field Descriptions

### Core Summary Fields
- **`balance`** - Total available balance (all time)
- **`income`** - **TODAY'S income only** (credit transactions from current date)
- **`expenses`** - **TODAY'S expenses only** (debit transactions from current date)
- **`total_income`** - Total income from all time
- **`total_expenses`** - Total expenses from all time
- **`total_transactions`** - Total number of transactions (all time)
- **`total_amount`** - Sum of all transaction amounts (all time)

### Breakdown Fields (Today Only)
- **`by_type`** - Breakdown by transaction type for today only
- **`by_category`** - Breakdown by transaction category for today only

## Backend Changes Made

### File: `src/controllers/transactionControllers.js`

**Updated `getTransactionSummary` function:**

1. **Added date filter for today's transactions:**
   ```sql
   -- Type breakdown (today only)
   WHERE user_id = ${userId} AND transaction_date = CURRENT_DATE
   
   -- Category breakdown (today only)  
   WHERE user_id = ${userId} AND category IS NOT NULL AND transaction_date = CURRENT_DATE
   ```

2. **Separate calculations for today vs all time:**
   ```javascript
   // Today's income and expenses
   let todayIncome = 0;
   let todayExpenses = 0;
   
   // Total balance (all time)
   const totalBalanceQuery = await sql`
       SELECT
           COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'credit' THEN amount ELSE 0 END), 0) as total_income,
           COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'debit' THEN amount ELSE 0 END), 0) as total_expenses
       FROM user_transactions
       WHERE user_id = ${userId}
   `;
   ```

3. **Updated response structure:**
   ```javascript
   const result = {
       balance: totalBalance,           // Total balance (all time)
       income: todayIncome,            // Today's income only
       expenses: todayExpenses,        // Today's expenses only
       total_income: totalIncome,      // Total income (all time)
       total_expenses: totalExpenses,  // Total expenses (all time)
       // ... other fields
   };
   ```

## Mobile App Updates

### Benefits:
1. **Daily Focus** - Users can see their daily spending patterns
2. **Total Overview** - Still see their complete financial picture

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User
```json
{
  "balance": 0.00,        // No transactions yet
  "income": 0.00,         // No income today
  "expenses": 0.00,       // No expenses today
  "total_income": 0.00,   // No income ever
  "total_expenses": 0.00  // No expenses ever
}
```

### Scenario 2: Active User
```json
{
  "balance": 1500.00,     // Total balance from all transactions
  "income": 200.00,       // Earned â‚¹200 today
  "expenses": 150.00,     // Spent â‚¹150 today
  "total_income": 3000.00, // Earned â‚¹3000 total
  "total_expenses": 1500.00 // Spent â‚¹1500 total
}
```

### Scenario 3: No Activity Today
```json
{
  "balance": 500.00,      // Total balance from previous days
  "income": 0.00,         // No income today
  "expenses": 0.00,       // No expenses today
  "total_income": 1000.00, // Earned â‚¹1000 total
  "total_expenses": 500.00 // Spent â‚¹500 total
}
```

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Test the endpoint
curl -X GET "https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/users/1/transactions/summary"
```

### Mobile Testing
```javascript
import { testUserEndpoint } from '../utils/apiTest';

// Test the updated endpoint
const result = await testUserEndpoint(1);
console.log('Today\'s Income:', result.data.summary.income);
console.log('Today\'s Expenses:', result.data.summary.expenses);
console.log('Total Balance:', result.data.summary.balance);
```

## Migration Notes

- **No breaking changes** - All existing fields are preserved
- **New fields added** - `total_income`, `total_expenses` for all-time data
- **Field meanings changed** - `income` and `expenses` now show today's values only
- **Mobile app updated** - Labels reflect the new meaning
- **Backward compatible** - Old clients will still work but may show confusing data

## Benefits

1. **Daily Tracking** - Users can easily see their daily financial activity
2. **Total Overview** - Complete financial picture is still available
3. **Better UX** - Clear distinction between daily and total values
4. **Actionable Insights** - Users can track daily spending patterns
5. **Flexible Data** - Both daily and total data available for different use cases

The transaction summary now provides both daily insights and total financial overview! ðŸŽ‰
